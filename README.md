# Corewar

The Canadian mathematician [Alexander Keewatin Dewdney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Dewdney) (author of "The Planiverse") first
introduced [Corewar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_War) in a series of Scientific American articles
starting in 1984.

> Core War was inspired by a story I heard some years ago about a mischievous
> programmer at a large corporate research laboratory I shall designate X. The
> programmer wrote an assembly-language program called Creeper that would
> duplicate itself every time it was run. It could also spread from one
> computer to another in the network of the X corporation. The program had no
> function other than to perpetuate itself. Before long there were so many
> copies of Creeper that more useful programs and data were being crowded out.
> The growing infestation was not brought under control until someone thought
> of fighting fire with fire. A second self-duplicating program called Reaper
> was written.  Its purpose was to destroy copies of Creeper until it could
> find no more and then to destroy itself. Reaper did its job, and things were
> soon back to normal at the X lab.

In this game, computer programs (called "Warriors") compete in a virtual arena
for digital supremacy. Warriors are written in a simple Assembly dialect inspired
from "Redcode".

## Virtual Machine
It is the *arena* in which our champion will be executed. It offers various functions, all of which will be useful for the battle of the champions. Obviously, the virtual machine should allow for numerous simultaneous processes. This virtual machine is known as a Memory Array Redcode Simulator.

## Assembler
This is the program that will compile our champion and translate it to *Bytecode*. This Bytecode will be directly interpreted by the Virtual Machine.

### Instructions
| OpName | OpCode  | Arg1 | Arg2 | Arg3 | Description | Carry | Cycles | LabelSize |
|:------:|:-------:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:-----------:|:-----:|:------:|:---------:|
| **live** | *0x01*  | T_DIR | | | The instruction that allows a process to stay alive. It can also record that the player whose number is the argument is indeed alive. No argument's coding byte. Its only argument is on 4 bytes. | No | 10 | 2 |
| **ld** | *0x02*  | T_DIR or T_IND | T_REG | | Take a random argument and a registry. Load the value of the first argument in the registry. It will change the carry. | Yes | 5 | |
| **st** | *0x03*  | T_REG | T_IND or T_REG | | Take a registry and a registry or an indirect and store the value of the registry toward a second argument. | Yes | 5 | |
| **add** | *0x04*  | T_REG | T_REG | T_REG | Take three registries, add the first two, and place the result in the third, right before modifying the carry. | Yes | 10 | |
| **sub** | *0x05*  | T_REG | T_REG | T_REG | Take three registries, substract the first two, and place the result in the third, right before modifying the carry. | Yes | 10 | |
| **and** | *0x06*  | T_REG or T_DIR or T_IND | T_REG or T_IND or T_DIR | T_REG | Apply an **&** (bit-to-bit AND) over the first two arguments and store the result in a registry, which is the third argument. It will change the carry. | Yes | 6 | 4 |
| **or** | *0x07*  | T_REG or T_DIR or T_IND | T_REG or T_IND or T_DIR | T_REG | Apply an **\|** (bit-to-bit OR) over the first two arguments and store the result in a registry, which is the third argument. It will change the carry. | Yes | 6 | 4 |
| **xor** | *0x08*  | T_REG or T_DIR or T_IND | T_REG or T_IND or T_DIR | T_REG | Apply an **^** (bit-to-bit XOR) over the first two arguments and store the result in a registry, which is the third argument. It will change the carry. | No | 6 | 4 |
| **zjmp** | *0x09*  | T_DIR | | | It take an index and jump to this address if the carry is 1. | No | 20 | 2 |
| **ldi** | *0x0A*  | T_REG or T_DIR or T_IND | T_DIR or T_REG | T_REG | It use 2 indexes and 1 registry, adding the first two, treating that like an address, reading value of a registry's size and putting in the third. | No | 25 | 2 |
| **sti** | *0x0B*  | T_REG | T_REG or T_DIR or T_IND | T_DIR or T_REG | Take a registry and 2 indexes (potentially registries), add the two indexes and use this result as an address where the value of the first parameter will be copied. | No | 25 | 2 |
| **fork** | *0x0C*  | T_DIR | | | Create a new process that will inherit the different states of its father, except its PC, which will be put at (PC + (1st parameter % IDX_MOD)). | No | 800 | 2 |
| **lld** | *0x0D*  | T_DIR or T_IND | T_REG | | Same as **ld**, but without % IDX_MOD. It will change the carry. | Yes | 10 | 4 |
| **lldi** | *0x0E*  | T_REG or T_DIR or T_IND | T_DIR or T_REG | T_REG | Same as **ldi**, but does not apply any modulo to the addresses. It will change the carry. | Yes | 50 | 2 |
| **lfork** | *0x0F*  | T_DIR | | | Same as **fork** without modulo in the address. | No | 1000 | 2 |
| **aff** | *0x10*  | T_REG | | | The registry content is interpreted by the character's ASCII value to display on the standard output (% 256).  | No | 2 | |

### Arguments
| Name | Sign | Binary Code | Encode |
|:----:|:----:|:-----------:|:------:|
| T_REG | **r** | 0b01 | 1 byte |
| T_DIR | **%** | 0b10 | 2 bytes or 4 bytes |
| T_IND | **%** or Value | 0b11 | 2 bytes |
